    "### Q1. What is the Probability Density Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Probability Density Function (PDF)** is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a particular value. The PDF must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "- The function must be non-negative for all possible values.\n",
    "- The area under the curve of the PDF over the entire range of possible values must equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a continuous random variable \\( X \\), the PDF is denoted as \\( f(x) \\), and the probability that \\( X \\) falls within a certain range is given by the integral of \\( f(x) \\) over that range."
